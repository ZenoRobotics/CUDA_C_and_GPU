# Course Outline:
- nVidia GPU Architecture to Support CUDA
- Intro to CUDA C and Host program format
- CUDA threads, blocks, and indexing
  - nvcc compiler
  - kernel launch
  - memory management
  - kernel and host code synchronization
- Tensor Cores: Architecture and NN Application
- CUDA Memory Hierarchy
- Shared memory and thread synchronization
DRAM Circuit Operation Considerations: Access Types, Latency Caused by Non-Batch Fetches

# Signup Instructions
Information about signing up for the 5hr courses I offer (The Zeno Institute of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence), is as follows:

You can purchase some of these courses through the [ZenoRobotcs.com](https://www.zenorobotics.com/courses) website. Other payment option is through Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, or Cash app. There is a $5/course savings for using Zelle. Please contact me for payment details for non-website methods.

Once you pay, I will send you a link to the booking calendar where you can setup your times.

When selecting your hour slots, please only choose an hour block for the first hour meeting. This will give me a chance to find out about your HW & SW setup, point out links to get you started, etc. Please limit any single day session to 2 hours max to give you time to absorb the concepts and do some programming/homework problems. Also, you donâ€™t have to book all 5 hr time slots at once. You can select them as time progresses if you wish.
